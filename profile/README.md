## What is this?

RandomSoup is a collection of random, unrelated projects which one or more of our developers work on. Nothing here has to be related with any other project under the organization, but we generally share ideas and sometimes work upon that, so much of the work published here was previously shared "internally", directly or indirectly.

Documentation can generally be found at [RandomSoup/docs](https://github.com/RandomSoup/docs) and devlogs / other random stuff goes in [RandomSoup/posts](https://github.com/RandomSoup/posts)

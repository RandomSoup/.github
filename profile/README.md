## What is this?

This is RandomSoup, an organization where a group of developers put their
random open source things. Nothing here has to be related with any other project
under the organization, but we generally share ideas and sometimes work upon
that, so much of the work published here was previously shared "internally",
directly or indirectly.

Just don't expect anything and you should be fine.
